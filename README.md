# xmlpg

XML Multi-Language Protocol Generator (XMLPG) is a XML-based network protocol implementation generator. Write an XML file and generate network message code.

XMLPG generates Java and C++ language protocol implementations from an abstract description of the protocol in XML. This release includes an example partial implementation of the Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) protocol.

Making use of XMLPG is typically a multi-step process. First of all, you need to write an XML file that describes the protocol. An example of this is the file `DIS2012.xml`. This file is used as input to the XMLPG program, which uses it to generate Java and C++ language implementations of the protocol. These language files need to be compiled themselves to generate a usable protocol.

## Compiling

The XMLPG system uses the Ant make system, available from Apache.org. The file `build.xml` contains several targets for both compiling the basic XMLPG system and compiling the source code that is generated by XMLPG. From the command line, and assuming that the ant executable is on the path, you can cause the targets to execute by typing `ant <targetName>`. A list of some of the targets is below:

* `compile`: Compiles the XMLPG program itself
* `dist`: default task, does most operations.
